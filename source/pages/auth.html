<!--
    This page will be loaded as an offscreen document.
    It will be used to authenticate the user with firebase. Here's how it works:

    1. When user signs into web app, the app will send a message to the extension which
    will include a custom token.
    2. When the extension receives the message from the web app, it will open the
    offscreen page (if it's not already opened), and use signInWithCustomToken()
    to authenticate the user.

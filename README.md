# Readefine Extension
This is the Readefine client extension. Using the build.js, we can build out the 5 extension versions (Chrome Edge, Firefox, Safari (iOS + MacOS)) - I've included Chrome, Edge, and Firefox in this repo.

## Build
This command will build the Chrome extension:
```npm run build```

This command will build the other versions in addition:
```npm run build -- all```

In case of an error:
```npm run build -- verbose```
